# Flashcards App
## Flashcards as a learning tool
 FlashCards are an excellent way to study through repetition since it's hard to keep track of a lot of things at once and brains are good at remembering things and processes once they've been done a lot.

 Basic competence learning is just building up a bunch of small parts and putting them together in a fluid way.
 ## Project Objectives
 The project aims to create an environment where a user can freely flip through a series of flash cards in order to reinforce their learning in a penalty free fashion.
